Easily add Private Messaging for your users to your WordPress site with Cartpauj PM (Private Messages).

== Description ==
Cartpauj PM (Private Messages) allows you to easily add a Private Messaging system to your Wordpress blog/site. Unlike other Private Messaging plugins available, Cartpauj PM works through a Page rather than the WP Dashboard -- This is very helpful if you want to keep users out of the Dashboard area! Please see the features and TODO lists below for more about what Cartpauj PM currently does and what's planned for the future.
